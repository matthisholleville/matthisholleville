### It's great to have you here! &nbsp;

As Head of SRE employed by [Agicap](https://agicap.com/), I take pleasure in resolving issues and automating tasks. I am motivated to work on projects that have a positive impact on the world and am always eager to acquire new knowledge and skills to further this goal. In my free time, you can find me doing CrossFit, which I absolutely love and find to be a great way to stay physically fit and mentally sharp.

Let's discuss personal matters:

- 🔭 I'm a co-maintainer on [k8sgpt](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt) & developping more tools [here](https://github.com/matthisholleville)
- 👨🏻‍💻 I love go, python, Kubernetes and more...
